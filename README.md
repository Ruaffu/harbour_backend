*Projects which are expected to use this start-code are projects that require all, or most of the following technologies:*
 - *JPA and REST*
- *Testing, including database test*
- *Testing, including tests of REST-API's*
- *CI and CONTINUOUS DELIVERY*

### Preconditions
*In order to use this code, you should have a local developer setup + a "matching" droplet on Digital Ocean as described in the 3. semester guidelines* 

### Getting Started

This document explains how to use this code (build, test and deploy), locally with maven, and remotely with maven controlled by Github actions
 - [How to use](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rymrRWF3VVR7ujo3k3sSGD_27q73meGeiMYtmUtYt6c/edit?usp=sharing)

### JPA snippets

### Security
- Passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt

### Endpoints
- catRousource enpoint /api/cat/facts and /api/cat/cats
- DemoResource contains user authentication for 'User' and 'Admin' roles /api/info/user and /api/info/admin

### Setup in Intellij
- open view->too windows->persistence
- open the Database tab and create a new data source (remember to point to a database event though this is already written in the persistence unit. This is necessary in order to use the JPQL console)
- in the persistence window right click the pu or an entity and choose "console"
- write a jpql query in the console and execute it.



### create entities from database in Intellij (Persistence mappings)
- From inside the Persistence window:
- Right-click a persistence unit, point to Generate Persistence Mapping and select By Database Schema.
- Select the 
  - data source 
  - package
  - tick tables to include
  - open tables to see columns and add the ones with mapped type: Collection<SomeEntity> and SomeEntity
  - click OK.

### In netbeans it is much easier
- Right click project name -> new -> persistence -> Entity classes From Database -> choose database connection from list -> add the tables you need -> Finish
